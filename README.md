### Unique OCR-to-Analysis Pipeline

This chatbot features a sophisticated document processing pipeline:

1. When you upload a medical document image, it first goes through OCR processing
2. The raw OCR text is automatically sent to Gemini AI for initial formatting and structuring
3. The formatted text appears in the text area for your review
4. You can then send this pre-processed text for final analysis, or modify it if needed
5. The entire process happens in the background, providing a seamless experience
